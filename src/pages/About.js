                Hello, welcome to my website. I'm glad you're here, and I hope we will eventually get to know more about each other. I guess I can get the ball rolling first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me give you a little background of myself. 
                I graduated from university with a marketing degree. I interned at a digital marketing agency for a few months in Kuala Lumpur before returning to Kota Kinabalu to try out a couple of things on my own. Eventually, I got into sales by being a real estate negotiator for a few months before the pandemic took over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the quarantine, I realised that being a real estate negotiator does not bring me joy and technology and being creative does. 
                So I did some digging and discovered front-end web development pretty much is a mix of both worlds. When I was able to fly over to Kuala Lumpur amid a pandemic to attend a full-stack web developer Bootcamp, I took it. (Took all the necessary precaution and abode all the SOP. Stay safe).
            </p>
            <p>
                So that's where I am today. I've completed the Bootcamp and now ready to enter the workforce and contribute and grow with a company. How can I contribute to your company? Well, 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm flexible; I'm willing to do any task; regardless it's a mundane task or an exciting new project. </li>
                <li>I'm timely. I don't like being late for anything. At least I try not to to the best of my ability.</li>
                <li>Detailed-oriented. I try my best to analyse everything from A to Z.</li>
                <li>I would say I'm honest, but that still depends on our interaction and for you to judge. (So let's get in touch.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I've attached my resume here for you to have a look at my credentials as I don't want to be too wordy here. If you want to get in touch, please feel free to do so. You can reach me via email, LinkedIn, and contact number.
